# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This is the first project of the semester! It was aimed at refreshing a lot of basic HTML rules. A simple website with interactive button was made.

## Running this Repository
To view the site for code review, download Live Preview in your IDE of choice if you have not done so already. After this, clone my repository and start the live preview. You can either stay in the IDE pop-up, or copy the url into a browser of your choosing in the case the button does not work since it is a pop-up in your IDE.

## Sources and Credits

The main help I got from this project was all of my code from CS 208.
